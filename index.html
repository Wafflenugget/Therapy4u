  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>TRC (Therapy for Kids Ages 6-13) is dedicated to providing comprehensive therapeutic services for children in a nurturing and supportive environment.</p>
  <p>Our therapists are highly trained and experienced in working with children, ensuring that each therapy session is effective and beneficial.</p>

  <h2>The Cost To Book An Appointment</h2>
  <p>Since some parents and kids are poor, and can't afford therapy, we (my crew and I) decided to make therapy for kids but cheap and run by us, KIDS!</p>
  <p>Our therapists are experienced in working with children and have their own common problems that they can also help you overcome, ensuring that each therapy session is effective and beneficial.
   TRC has only two main therapy types, individual therapy and group therapy each one has its own priority goals for you to accomplish. For example, individual therapy is where you only share your problems to one person who can solve it while group therapy is where you communicate and thrive with people and compromise and meet your goals faster than ever!
  So moving on, Group therapy is slightly costlier than individual therapy as you talk and share your problems with others and learn more than ever about anyone.
  So therefore, Group therapy is 220¥ while individual therapy is 150¥.</p>
